                Legacy-Builder Program – we’ve leveraged our extensive experience in the life coaching space to create a legacy building program that can be tailored to cover the client’s change agenda, needs, values and results. Using a host of resources, we help our clients to assess, identify, create and pursue a successful legacy as well as refocus their present life for greater energy, fulfillment and productivity.
