                Lifeâ€™s realities

You are the face of success to the public, but the truth is success has not brought you the fulfillment you desire. You desire to leave a story that does not only give back to the world but also cements your unique identity and the role or mark that you want to leave on the world. You desire to channel the feeling of powerlessness from the uncertainties of life into a fruitful outlet. But your desire is often frustrated by personal and professional roadblocks, sporadic spurts of motivation, lack of confidence and resolve. Achieving clarity, overcoming the fear of failure, becoming rooted in your self-value, and being held accountable to act on your ideas will be some of the key tools you will need, acquire and use to create your change agenda and design your legacy.

Preliminary Assessment

1. what will live beyond you?

2. If you were to have your last party, ever, how many people would be there?

3. How big do you want your life to be?

Achieve clarity on what you want. Actively design and pursue a satisfying legacy. Become confident that your footprint will not fade.
